4)We have installed the VS code. We will start coding.
5)We will install code Runner to run C++ in the VS code itself.
6)Now we will download a MinGW to run the code in C++.
7)Then we will can start coding without a problem in the VS code.
8)Stop
CONCLUSION- We will learn how to download and run few codes in the Visual Studio code in C++.
