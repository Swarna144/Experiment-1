                      EXPERIMENT 1
AIM- To installing visual studio code and performing few coding in C++

THEORY- Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers. Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

ALGORITHM- 

1)Start

2)Open your web browser, go to the visual studio code website.

3)We will download VS code in window  in the website.
   
4)We have installed the VS code. We will start coding.

5)We will install code Runner to run C++ in the VS code itself.

6)Now we will download a MinGW to run the code in C++.

7)Then we will can start coding without a problem in the VS code.

8)Stop
